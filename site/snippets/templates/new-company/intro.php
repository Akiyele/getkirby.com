      The Bastian Allgeier GmbH has been the company behind Kirby <a class="link" href="<?= url('10') ?>">since 2013</a>. In the last years, Kirby has grown from Bastian’s <nobr>side-project</nobr> into a team effort.
    <p>
    <p>That's why we – <a class="link whitespace-nowrap" href="https://github.com/bastianallgeier">Bastian</a>, <a class="link whitespace-nowrap" href="https://github.com/texnixe">Sonja</a>, <a class="link whitespace-nowrap" href="https://github.com/lukasbestle">Lukas</a> and <a class="link whitespace-nowrap" href="https://github.com/distantnative">Nico</a> – decided to start a new company together that is entirely owned by the team: The <mark>Content Folder GmbH & Co. KG</mark> has been officially registered and is ready to go.</p>
    <p>This doesn't change anything for you: Together with <a class="link whitespace-nowrap" href="https://github.com/afbora">Ahmet</a> we will continue to build Kirby as the CMS that adapts best to you and your project, just as before. Same team, same roadmap, same support, same pricing. The new company sets a solid foundation for Kirby's future.</p>

Please transfer your existing licenses and agree to our <a class="link whitespace-nowrap" href="<?= url('license') ?>">updated license terms</a> to make this possible.</p>
    <p>We want to be as transparent as possible with our company transition. If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:support@getkirby.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
