The new languages view is now only visible in the menu when you switch to a multi-language setup. It features the same language editor from previous versions. We will be extending this view with more options in the future.

## Permissions

The languages view can be switched on or off by role with the new access permissions:

```yaml
# users/editor.yml
title: Editor
permissions:
  access:
    languages: false
```
