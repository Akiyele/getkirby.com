Title: Home option for users

Intro:

Text:

When a user logs in to the Panel, they normally get redirected to the last view they've been on before they've been logged out or the Site view. When you work with permissions, you might want to block the Site view or redirect the user to a completely different view instead. This is now possible with the new `home` option for user blueprints. This way you can define the redirect for each role individually. Redirects can be simple paths or dynamic locations via string queries.

## Simple paths

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
home: /panel/account
```

## Queries to panel views

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
home: "{{ site.find('blog').children.first.panel.url }}"
```

## Queries to pages

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
home: "{{ site.find('blog').children.first.url }}"
```
