## Blueprint options

You can fine-tune the writer field from your blueprint, by defining the availabel block formats (nodes).

Unsupported formats will automatically be ignored when content is pasted and the toolbar will also not include the matching buttons.

```yaml
fields:
  writer:
    type: writer
    nodes:
      - heading
      - bulletList
      - orderedList
```
