Title: Slug field
----
Intro:
----
Text:

The new slug field is perfect when you want to create sanitized strings for IDs, URL paths, css class names, etc.

## Setup

```yaml
fields:
  className:
    label: Class Name
    type: slug
```

## Sync option

You can sync the slug field with another field. Whenever the editor types something into the synced field, the slug field will update with a sluggified version of the input:

```yaml
fields:
  className:
    label: Class Name
    type: slug
    sync: title
```

## Allow option

By default, the slug field will strip out or replace any non-alphabetic, non-numeric character with a simple dash. You can define additional allowed characters with the allow option:

```yaml
fields:
  className:
    label: Class Name
    type: slug
    sync: title
    allow: _
```
