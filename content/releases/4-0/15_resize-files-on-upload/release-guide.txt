Text:

File blueprints can now set resize and crop settings, which will be applied directly after upload. This is great to prevent huge original files in the content folder.

```yaml
title: Image
create:
  width: 500
  height: 500
  crop: true
```

This feature also adds a new `$file->manipulate(array $options)` method. It accepts the same resizing and crop options of Kirby's image processing API (see [`$file->thumb()`](/docs/reference/objects/cms/file/thumb) method) and replaces the original file with the resized version.
