Time-based one-time codes (TOTP) are now supported for two-factor authentication and will be used, when activated for the use, instead one-time codes via email:

```php "site/config/config.php"
<?php
return [
  'auth' => [
    'methods' => [
      'password' => ['2fa' => true]
    ]
  ]
];
```

Each user can set up TOTP in the account view in the Panel, adding their secret key to their authenticator app.

## QR codes
As a side benefit to adding TOTP support, QR code generation is now directly built into Kirby:

```php
$qr = new Kirby\Image\QrCode('https://getkirby.com');
$qr->toSvg(color: '#ff00ff');
$qr->toDataUri(color: '#ff00ff');

$page->myLinkField()->toQrCode()->toSvg();
```
