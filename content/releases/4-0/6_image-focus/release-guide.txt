- Or directly in the content file:

```js
Focus: 70% 30%
```

## En-/disable setting focus in Panel

By default, setting the focus point in the Panel is enabled for all viewable images with a Panel preview and disabled for all other files. You can change this via the `focus` option in the file's blueprint:

```yaml "site/blueprints/files/image.yml"
focus: false
```
