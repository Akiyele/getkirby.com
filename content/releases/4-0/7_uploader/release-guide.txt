## Optimize Files On Upload

File blueprints can now set resize and crop settings, which will be applied directly after the upload. This is great to avoid huge original files in the content folder. (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file#optimize-uploaded-images text: → Learn more)

```yaml
title: Image
create:
  width: 500
  height: 500
  crop: true
```

This feature also adds a new `$file->manipulate(array $options)` method. It takes the usual resizing and crop options of Kirby's image processing API and replaces the original file with the resized version.
