Title: What happens with the versioning scheme?
----
Text:

Kirby 3 follows a `{generation}.{major}.{minor}.{patch}` versioning scheme. With Kirby 4 we are moving to `{major}.{minor}.{patch}`. This means that:

- Kirby will follow semantic versioning,
- major versions will no longer be bound to automatic paid upgrades and
- future versions will bring continuity and will be much more plannable for you and for us.
