Title: Why Kirby 4?
----
Text:

We are not making a generation jump this time like we did from Kirby 2 to Kirby 3. Instead we are building on the solid foundation that we built with Kirby 3 and continously improved in every release since then.

Now we are moving from 3.9 to 3.10 but we call it 4.0 and here's why:

- Kirby 4 will allow us to move forward with a new versioning scheme for major versions that follows semantic versioning.
- The new generation number will keep Kirby sustainable, allowing us to continue to invest both in new features and a high-quality foundation.

We consider stability and reliability core features of Kirby, so it is really important to us to keep continuity. While Kirby 4 will come with many great new features and enhancements, it is not a departure from Kirby 3 as much as the name may make it sound like.
