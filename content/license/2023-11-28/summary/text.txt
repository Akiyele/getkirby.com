The updated terms are binding for all newly purchased licenses.

In particular, we have changed the following:

Text:

- The updated license terms now feature a Summary section for easier understanding.
- License changes align with Kirby 4+, introducing a new license model which covers free updates for three years after activating the license.
- The revised terms introduce license tiers (e.g., Basic and Enterprise) with qualification matching upon purchase, upgrade, or license transfer.
- The relationship between the licensee and clients (e.g. an agency creating websites for other companies) is better reflected in the terms.
- A commitment to security support is incorporated, guaranteeing three years of support for every major release.
- A new provision outlines the intent to release Kirby as FOSS in case of discontinuation of further maintenance.
