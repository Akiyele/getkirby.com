Title: New EULA: Summary of changes

----

Intro:

On March 15, 2022, we switched to our (link: new-company text: new team company). In this switch, we needed to update the license agreement (EULA) and used the opportunity to incorporate feedback we received in the previous months.

Our goal is to give you and your clients more legal certainty. Nothing changes in practice for paid licenses, but now your rights are written in black and white. At the same time we have clarified ambiguous parts of the EULA.

In particular, we have changed the following:

----

Text:

## Your rights

- We explicitly grant you more rights for working with Kirby. For example:
  - ...you may make copies of Kirby for the purpose of deployment or development,
  - ...you may use Kirby with or for third parties in defined cases (like with clients, freelancers or agencies) and
  - ...you may use the MIT-licensed parts of the code for other projects.
- We explicitly state that you have the right to transfer licenses to a different licensee or to reassign licenses to a different project by requesting the transfer or reassignment from us.
- Future changes to the EULA that constrain your rights to a great extent require your approval.

## License restrictions

- It is no longer possible to use Kirby for free in an intranet. The free use for development or for personal or family apps is still allowed.
- The EULA now has a specific list of disallowed uses instead of a blanket statement that allowed us to determine if a use qualified under the agreement.

## Clarifications

- We have clarified the definition of cross-domain multi-language installations that only need a single license.
- We have clarified that headless or static sites built or generated with Kirby are defined by their frontend domain and root directory.
- For an easier understanding we have replaced the term "Development Machine" with the new terms "Development Installation" and "Private Installation".
- We clarified that the license restrictions and the warranty exclusion also apply to free licenses and to users who are not a licensee.
- We have reworded some sentences to make them easier to read and understand or to fix typos.
- We have also made minor editorial changes that don't change the general meaning of the EULA.

## Boring legalese

- The licensor is now the Content Folder GmbH & Co. KG.
- A termination of the agreement now only requires the textual form instead of a written letter and does not need to be declared for all licenses at once.
- We defined that the place of jurisdiction is generally Germany (except for consumers in the European Union).
- We added a severability clause to avoid that licenses become void if only a part of the EULA turns out to be invalid.
