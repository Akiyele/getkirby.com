Title: What happens when the 3 years of free updates are over?
----
Text:

When you reach the end of your free update period, you have two choices:

1. You can buy another 3 years of free updates. This will not happen automatically though. We leave it up to you.
2. You can keep the latest included version up and running for as long as you like at no extra costs.

You can also pause and get another round of free updates any time later. Technically, this would probably count as third choice.
