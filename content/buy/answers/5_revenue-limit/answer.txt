Title: Can you tell me more about the revenue limit?
----
Text:

With an enterprise license, you don't have a revenue limit and you can simply ignore this.

The basic license covers projects for companies and organisations with a yearly revenue of less than â‚¬ 1 million.

Revenue means net sales. Should you not have any sales (e.g. as a non-profit), the ongoing funding is relevant instead.

If you are building a website for a client (as a freelancer or agency), we don't care about your revenue, but about the revenue of your client.

We only care about the revenue at the time of purchase. If your company becomes more successful within the next 3 years and crosses the limit, we are really happy for you, but you don't need to get a different license.
