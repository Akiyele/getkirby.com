Title: What is your new company name about?
----
Text:

The content folder is the place where all content is stored in Kirby. It’s the database, the heart and soul of every project. Without your content, Kirby and our work would be meaningless. It seemed like a very good fit for our name.

GmbH & Co. KG is our company form. It translates to: limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner. It offers a very flexible and robust foundation for our future.

The limited liability company is the Content Folder Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH. (Translation: Content Folder Administration Company With Limited Liability) – no pun intended.

Germans like to be complicated sometimes. But we really love our new name and we hope you like it too.

Fun fact: it does not fit on our company credit card.
