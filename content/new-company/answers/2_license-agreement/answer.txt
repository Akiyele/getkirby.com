Title: What has changed in the license agreement and why?
----
Text:

We based the changes to our license agreement (EULA) on feedback we received in the last months. Our goal is to give you and your clients more legal certainty. Nothing changes in practice for paid licenses, but now your rights are written in black and white. At the same time we have clarified ambiguous parts of the EULA.

Reading changes to legal documents like our EULA can be daunting. We want to make the revised EULA and its changes as approachable as possible. So we have prepared the following resources for you:

- You can (link: license/2022-03-15/summary text: read a summary of the changes).
- You can (link: license/2022-03-15?diff text: view the full set of changes as a diff).
- And if you are into that sort of thing, you can also (link: license text: read the full license text). :)
