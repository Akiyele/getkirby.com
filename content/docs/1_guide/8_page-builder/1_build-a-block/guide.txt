## What makes a block?

A block type is made up of three components:

1. A PHP code (glossary: snippet text: snippet) to render the block content in the frontend
2. A block (glossary: blueprint text: blueprint) which tells Kirby which fields should be available in the block
3. An (optional) Panel preview for the WYSIWYG experience

You can find the source files for the existing block types in the (link: docs/reference/panel/blocks text: documentation for each block type).

With this knowledge, we can go ahead and either modify existing block types or create new ones.

## Modifying default block types

You can customize all existing block types to your needs in one or all of the following ways:

1. Change how the block renders in the frontend by overwriting the snippet for the block
2. Add or replace fields in a block type by overwriting the (glossary: blueprint) file for the block type. This will often go hand in hand with modifying the output as in point 1.
3. Change how the block looks in the Panel by overwriting its preview.

To modify a block, you can use the standard blueprints, snippets, and previews of each block type as a basis for your changes. (link: docs/cookbook/panel/block-basics#extending-core-blocks text: Read moreâ€¦)

## Custom block types

You create custom block types from the same three components. If you don't need a visual preview, you even make do with only a blueprint and a snippet. Learn how to create your own custom block types with our extensive documentation:
